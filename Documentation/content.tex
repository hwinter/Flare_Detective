\section{Introduction}
	The Feature Finding Team (FFT) is an international consortium with the task to produce a comprehensive automated feature and event recognition system for SDO.It provides several different modules to look at different features and events.The flare detective is the module with the  task of detecting flares from AIA images
	\subsection{}
	\subsubsection{}

\section{Algorithm}

FFT modules works a bit differently then the way one would build such a module if all data was availableThe flare detective is fed one image at a timeThere is no options to retrieve that image at a later timeAll relevant information about past images is stored in an internal status of the moduleOne instance of the flare detective works with images from one AIA channel (independently from other instances of the module that may be running on otehr channels)

The large AIA images are segmented in a small number of macropixelsLightcurves are computed for each macropixelsFlares start times are determined when the derivative of the lightcurve reaches a certain threshold  Flares end times are determined when the flux is lower then a certain fraction of the peak flux

%	Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is a system through which Internet television services are delivered using the architecture and networking methods of the Internet Protocol Suite over a packet-switched network infrastructure, e.g. the Internet and broadband Internet access networks, instead of being delivered through traditional radio frequency broadcast, satellite signal, and cable television.\cite{IPTV}\\
