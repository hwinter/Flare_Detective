Note: The regression test is currently set to point to the libraries accessible on the Mac cluster (e.g., sdo1). From other systems, you may need to update the 
library directories defined at the beginning of regtest.script.

To execute the regression test, execute the following while in the 
regression/bin directory:

./regtest.script

This script will automatically run the regression test, compare the results and provide a report on the comparison.
