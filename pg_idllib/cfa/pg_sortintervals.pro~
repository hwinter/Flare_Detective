; NAME:
;
; pg_sortintervals
;
; PURPOSE:
;
; hard to explain... let's try: let the inputs be two set of number,
; the "in" numbers and the "out" numbers. Ideally, they would describe
; a set of interval between each pair of "in" and "out" numbers.
; That means that the intervals would be described by in[0]:out[0],
; in[1]:out[1], etc. etc. Now the purpose of this routine is to fix
; input arrays in and out that have some mismatch in them, for instance
; in[2] lies between in[1] and out[1]. In such a case, in[2] will be deleted.
